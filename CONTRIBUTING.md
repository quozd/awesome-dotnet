# Contribution Guidelines

## New entry format

* Use the following format: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION
* The link should be the name of the package or project
* Keep descriptions concise, clear and simple
* New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are also welcome

## Pull requests workflow

* **Submit one link per pull request.** If you want to add several links, create a PR for each one, unless all of the proposed projects belong to the same category. Pull requests should have a meaningful project description, why do you want to add it to the list and any other relevant information. This will help maintainers with the review process.
* **Include a link to the added project in the PR description.** This will greatly improve email messages received by everyone watching this repository.

## Quality standard

To stay on the list, projects should follow these quality standards:

* Generally useful to the community
* Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when they arise)
* Stable
* Documented
* Tests

## Research projects

If you are to include a research or academic project, please use the `**[Research]**` tag.

## Proprietary/commercial software notice

We have additional requirements for proprietary and commercial projects:

* Publicly available community forum or other place for discussions and support
* At least 1 year on the market
* Free trial or preview
* You should add `**[$]**` tag to the end of the description block (in bold)
* If project is proprietary but still free to use, instead if `**[$]**` tag, please add `**[Proprietary]**` and `**[Free]**` tags.
* If project has free for OSS version, please add `**[Free for OSS]**` tag to the end of the description (in bold)
